## The Dog chases its own Tail

1. I want to publish a binary module to the PowerShell Gallery.
2. To do this, you call ```Publish-Module```.
3. ```Publish-Module``` publishes a locally installed module to the gallery.
4. To locally install a module, you call ```Install-Module```.
5. ```Install-Module``` installs a module from a repository like the gallery.
6. To do this, the module must be published to the gallery.

I eventually found the [solution](https://tldag.github.io/tldag-dotnet/write-ps-module.html).
